 * Also consider setting {@link IMIOptions.maxReturnedRecords} property to the lowest possible value for list transactions when applicable.

 * **Example**
 * ```typescript
 * const record = { USID: 'MVXSECOFR' };
 * const request = {
 *    program: 'MNS150',
 *    transaction: 'GetUserData',
 *    record: record,
 *    outputFields: ['CONO', 'DIVI', 'USID', 'NAME']
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * You can also use the [[MIRecord]] class to set input data to get date or numeric values converted to the correct format.
 *
 * **Example**
 * ```
 * const record = new MIRecord();
 * const today = new Date();
 * record.setDateString('LSTD', today);
 *
 * const quantity = 1.5;
 * record.setNumberString('QQTY', quantity);
